# semver-yourself

One day I noticed that concepts of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) apply surprisingly well to my life story. Major version marks self-reinventions and identity pivots. Minor version goes for new realisations, roles or behaviors. And optional patch version is for all those little steps forward along the life journey.

Then I thought, this could be an interesting concept to play with. Maybe someone would find this useful beyond a funny thought experiment. It was quite challenging to track back minor versions though, so strictly speaking it’s not really semver. But anyway.

## v0.x “hello world”

I remember little to none of my early childhood. According to my parents I was extremely overactive and ignorant of any social order. I loved tearing things apart, watching construction machinery operating, climbing trees and digging deep holes in the backyard.

## v1.x “joyful bookworm”

My memories of those times are quite blurry. I read like crazy, especially pop science. Nuclear reactors was my favourite topic. I loved playing chess with my dad. I didn’t socialise much. My mom says I was often bullied at school but I neither cared nor noticed somehow.

## v2.x “nerdy prankster”

I spent days building custom cars out of Lego Technic, and kept reading lots of books. My lifelong best friend shared the passion for Lego, so we’d sit in the back of the classroom and build things. Another passion of mine was everything that burned and / or exploded. I’d make all sorts of dangerous things out of matches, fireworks and basic chemistry. Some of my tricks caused concerns at school but my studies were stellar so I didn’t get much trouble.

## v3.x “computer geek”

Shortly after I discovered boundless capabilities of a computer, this was all I did. I stopped doing math competitions and was reading much less now. I’d spend nights at my dad’s office playing with all sorts of software, browsing internet, digging into system internals and trying things. And we’d have night-long binges at my best friend’s house building stuff in Flash and HTML. I also started to socialise a bit more, a close circle of friends formed.
