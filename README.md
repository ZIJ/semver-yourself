# semver-yourself

One day I noticed that concepts of semantic versioning apply surprisingly well to my life story. Major version marks self-reinventions and identity pivots. Minor version goes for new realisations, roles or behaviors. And optional patch version is for all those little steps forward along the life journey.

Then I thought, this could be an interesting concept to play with. Maybe someone would find this useful beyond a funny thought experiment. It was quite challenging to track back minor versions though, so strictly speaking it’s not really semver. But anyway.

## v0.x “hello world”

I remember little to none of my early childhood. According to my parents I was extremely overactive and ignorant of any social order. I loved tearing things apart, watching construction machinery operating, climbing trees and digging deep holes in the backyard.
